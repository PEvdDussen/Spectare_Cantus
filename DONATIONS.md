# Support Spectare Cantus

If you are interested in supporting the development of this engine—whether through musical expertise or professional recordings—please reach out via GitHub issues. Your time and effort will be greatly appreciated.

If you are considering providing financial support I would highly encourage you to rather give it to your church.
There are families and individuals that would appreciate that same money far more than this project ever could. Thank you.

Every bit of support helps in bringing high-fidelity, localized Psalmody to the global church.
